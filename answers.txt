Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is a version control system that helps people manage their 
code and track changes in their code. Git also keeps code history which 
means people can go back to previous versions of their code if needed. 
Furthermore, Git allows multiple people to work on the same code by using 
branches, and also has easy access for people to "push" and "pull" code.
